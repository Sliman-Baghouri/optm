## Project Implementation Overview

This document provides an overview of the project implementation, detailing the approach taken to address the project requirements and ensuring scalability, accuracy in design conversion, and effective Cloudcannon integration.

### 1. Base Template Scalability
The `baseof.html` file was refactored to be more generic and scalable.

- Introduced reusable partials for header, footer, and meta sections.
- Used Hugo's `block` and `define` functions to create a flexible layout structure that can dynamically adapt to different content types and pages.
- Updated the layout to support dynamic page rendering, including support for single posts and list views.

### 2. Posts and Page Support

- Added `single.html` and `list.html` templates to properly render individual posts and their listings.
- Ensured that both templates utilize shared components for consistency across the site.

### 3. Fonts and Spacing

- Fixed font family issues by switching the body font to Inter as specified in the feedback while keeping DM Sans for headings.
- Adjusted font sizes, spacings, and paddings to closely match the Figma file.

### 4. Cloudcannon Integration

- Configured collections to display in the Cloudcannon sidebar for easier navigation.
- Added input types for front matter fields (e.g., title, date, featuredImage, tags, and categories) to enable seamless editing.

### 5. Code Structure and Organization

- Organized the code into logical directories (`partials`, `layouts`, etc.) to maintain clarity and reusability.
- Used Tailwind's utility-first approach to keep CSS minimal and inline with modern best practices.
